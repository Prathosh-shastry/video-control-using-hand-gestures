# video-control-using-hand-gestures
In this project, my role was to design and to interface ultrasound sensors for sensing the hand movement which in turn controls volume, fast forward, and rewind the video. It can also be implemented for playing games, Arduino IDE and IDLE are interfaced using COM port available in the computer and py.serial function available in IDLE.
